# Kaggle-Home-Challenge
working on my Data analysis skills
In this Project, I am focusing on Data pre-processing skills.
How to Handle Missing Data, Label Encoding, Encoding for Categorical Features, How to working with data related to Year/Age, Feature Engineering, Features Selection.
Understanding How Kurtosis and Skewness affect your model.

Check Out Data_Processing.ipynb, UsingNN.ipynb. Thanks 

PS:
I know merging multiple models into one is giving better result for this Challenge. I will soon add one Ensemble model also.
